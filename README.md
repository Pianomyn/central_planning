Potential frontend libraries:

- TailwindCSS (Utility classes rather than semantic classes)
- Redux: State management (maybe not necessary)
- React Motion / Chart.js: (Animation and charts)

Potential Backend/middleware libraries:

- GraphQL (Unlike REST, I can define my own query/dictionary to fetch. Eliminates over/underfetching)
